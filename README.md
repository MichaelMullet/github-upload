Hello! These are all my projects and assignments I built to learn python in my first few months.
The "AtBS Book" folder consists of projects from the book Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart.
The "MITx Class" folder consists of projects, assignments, and tests from the MITx course "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" on EdX.
