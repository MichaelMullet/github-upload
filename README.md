# Starting Projects
**Hello!** These are all the projects and assignments I built to learn python in my first few months.

The `AtBS Book` folder consists of projects from the book [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

The `MITx Class` folder consists of projects, assignments, and tests from the MITx course [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) on [EdX](https://www.edx.org/).
